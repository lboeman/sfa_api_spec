# Solar Forecast Arbiter OpenAPI Specification

*A provisional specification written in markdown can be found in [markdown_spec.md](markdown_spec.md).*


The [api_spec.yaml](api_spec.yaml) file is an api spec written using [Open API](https://www.openapis.org/) (formerly known as the Swagger specification). This allows us to provide a standardized api specification which may be rendered as interactive documentation for our api. See [Swaggerhub Petstore Example](https://petstore.swagger.io/#/).

To make it simpler to provide feedback and view the spec while being developed a markdown file has been provided as noted above.
This spec can be viewed locally using [Swagger Editor](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor).
Note that the editor does not work on a file in place, and instead stores a copy in your browser. You will
Need to import the spec, edit, and download it from your browser and manually move/rename it.
